# <a name="_page2_x70.00_y71.68"></a>Theme: Academic Support 
The overarching theme of the academic support web app is to empower students at the University of Pretoria to excel in their studies by providing them with a comprehensive and personalised platform for academic success. 

At its core, the web app centres around the concept of holistic academic support by including module-specific advice from previous students and also study groups for students to utilise. It recognizes that students' success is not only dependent on classroom learning but also on their ability to effectively manage different aspects of their academic life. Each student can curate their own academic journey based on their enrolled modules and preferences.

**The dataset explores whether respondents desire more assistance with their academic work.** 

![](/Documentation/Images/Aspose.Words.27365739-b6e0-4e6a-ba0b-3e239b8995cc.016.png)

The data highlights a strong inclination among respondents to seek more assistance with their academic work, with a substantial majority (88.1%) expressing a desire for additional support. Conversely, a      relatively small proportion (11.9%) indicated that they do not wish for more assistance as they feel they already have adequate support. These results underscore the perceived need for increased academic support among the surveyed individuals. 

**The dataset explores the methods that respondents typically initiate the process of seeking help.** 

![](/Documentation/Images/Aspose.Words.27365739-b6e0-4e6a-ba0b-3e239b8995cc.017.png)

The data indicates a clear preference for initiating the process of seeking academic help online, with a significant majority (78.6%) of respondents favouring this method. In contrast, a smaller proportion (21.4%) indicated a preference for initiating help-seeking in-person. The dominant preference for online initiation suggests that digital platforms and resources play a substantial role in facilitating academic 

assistance.

**The dataset examines the comfort level of respondents when using online platforms.** 

![](/Documentation/Images/Aspose.Words.27365739-b6e0-4e6a-ba0b-3e239b8995cc.018.png)

The data reveals that a significant majority (88.1%) of respondents reported feeling comfortable using online platforms for their academic needs. None of the respondents indicated discomfort in utilizing     online resources for academic purposes, and only a small proportion (11.9%) expressed a neutral      stance. These results suggest a high degree of acceptance and confidence in using digital platforms for academic tasks.

**The dataset explores the comfort level when seeking help from peers who have already taken the module.**
